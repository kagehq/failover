# Failover

A tiny reverse proxy that sits in front of your app or API and makes downtime invisible. It routes all traffic to your primary service, fails over instantly to a backup when things break, and then fails back automatically when your primary recovers. No SDKs, no rewrites, just point DNS and sleep better.

## Why This Exists

Downtime isn‚Äôt just an inconvenience ‚Äî it destroys trust, revenue, and SLAs. Even the biggest companies suffer:
- 2024 ‚Äì CrowdStrike update outage ‚Üí airports, banks, and hospitals went offline worldwide.
- 2023 ‚Äì Cloudflare outage ‚Üí thousands of sites (including Shopify stores) disappeared for hours.
- 2021 ‚Äì Facebook global outage ‚Üí 3 billion users saw ‚Äúsite not available.‚Äù
-	AWS/GCP/Azure regularly have region-level incidents that take apps offline for hours.

If it happens to them, it can happen to you.

## What Failover Does
- Routes traffic to your primary service.
- Continuously health-checks it.
- If it fails ‚Üí instantly routes traffic to your backup (S3, static copy, or secondary region).
- Automatically recovers back when primary is healthy.
- Exposes /__failover/health and /__failover/state for monitoring, and can notify you (e.g., Slack) when failovers happen.

Your users keep seeing your site. You keep your SLA. Downtime becomes invisible.

## Quick Start

### Download Pre-built Binary

**One-line installer (auto-detects your platform):**

```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kagehq/failover/main/install.sh | bash
```

**Or download manually for your platform:**

```bash
# Linux & macOS (choose your architecture)
curl -L https://github.com/kagehq/failover/releases/latest/download/failover-linux-x86_64 -o failover      # Linux x86_64
curl -L https://github.com/kagehq/failover/releases/latest/download/failover-linux-aarch64 -o failover    # Linux ARM64
curl -L https://github.com/kagehq/failover/releases/latest/download/failover-macos-x86_64 -o failover     # macOS Intel
curl -L https://github.com/kagehq/failover/releases/latest/download/failover-macos-aarch64 -o failover    # macOS Apple Silicon
chmod +x failover

# Windows
curl -L https://github.com/kagehq/failover/releases/latest/download/failover-windows-x86_64.exe -o failover.exe
```

Then run:
```bash
./failover --primary=https://myapp.com --backup=https://myapp-backup.s3.amazonaws.com
```

### Run from source:

```bash
cargo run --release -- \
  --primary=https://myapp.com \
  --backup=https://myapp-backup.s3.amazonaws.com
```

### What this does:
- Compiles Failover Proxy (release mode for speed).
- Starts listening on `0.0.0.0:8080`.
- Routes all traffic to `https://myapp.com`.
- If primary fails ‚Üí instantly switches to `https://myapp-backup.s3.amazonaws.com`.
- Auto-recovers back to primary when healthy.


### Run from Docker:

#### 1. Download or Run

Build and run the Docker container with instant failover from `primary` to `backup`:

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t failover:latest .

# Run the proxy
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 failover:latest \
  --primary=https://myapp.com --backup=https://myapp-backup.s3.amazonaws.com
```
That's it, no config files, no setup. The container runs, and traffic is proxied with health-check failover baked in.  

#### 2. Configure
- Primary = their live service (app, API, site).
-  Backup = static copy, alternate region, cached mirror, even a ‚Äúsorry page.‚Äù
- Configured via flags or a YAML file.

#### 3. Point DNS
- They point myapp.com (or a subdomain like app.mycompany.com) to the proxy.
- From then on, all requests hit Failover Proxy first.

#### 4. Automatic Failover
- While healthy: traffic ‚Üí primary.
- If health checks fail 3x in a row (configurable): traffic ‚Üí backup.
- While failing: proxy keeps checking primary in the background.
- After 2x successful health checks: traffic ‚Üí primary again.

#### 5. Observe
- Check `http://proxy:8080/__failover/state` to see:

```json
  { "on_backup": true, "since_unix": 1738512461, "primary": "...", "backup": "..." }
```

## Auto Incident Reports ‚úÖ

Failover automatically sends detailed incident reports when failover events occur. Get notified instantly on Slack, Discord, or any webhook-compatible service when your primary service fails or recovers.

### Features
- üö® **Instant Alerts**: Real-time notifications when failover occurs
- ‚úÖ **Recovery Notifications**: Get notified when primary service recovers
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Downtime Tracking**: Automatically calculates and reports downtime duration
- üìä **Rich Details**: Includes fail count, timestamps, URLs, and error messages
- üé® **Formatted Messages**: Beautiful, color-coded notifications for Slack and Discord

### Quick Setup

**Slack:**
```bash
failover \
  --primary=https://myapp.com \
  --backup=https://myapp-backup.s3.amazonaws.com \
  --webhook-url=https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK/URL \
  --webhook-format=slack
```

**Discord:**
```bash
failover \
  --primary=https://myapp.com \
  --backup=https://myapp-backup.s3.amazonaws.com \
  --webhook-url=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/YOUR/WEBHOOK/URL \
  --webhook-format=discord
```

**Or via config file:**
```yaml
webhook_url: "https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK/URL"
webhook_format: "slack"  # or "discord"
```

### Notification Example

When failover occurs, you'll receive a notification like:
```
üö® Failover Incident Report
